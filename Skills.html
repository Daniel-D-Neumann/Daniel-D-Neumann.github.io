									<h2>My Skills:</h2>
									&nbsp;
									<h3>Languages -</h3>
									&nbsp;
									<h1>Python</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									Several years of study with python has granted me an acute method of critical thinking and problem abstraction. 
									I have experience with OOP, building games, database handling, and data analysis (ask me personally about this!).
								</p>
								<header>
									<h1>C++</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									With a year of knowledge in C++ I've become a lot more comfortable with the language and it's core conepts,
									while I don't have as much experience as in python, I believe I'd be able to face any new challenge with a positive outlook. 
									I'm also constantly working on improving my c++ knowledge currently, and have recently done some work with a 3D graphics pipeline.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h1>C# (Unity)</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have used C# for various unity projects and feel comfortable with the syntax, 
									though I have little knowledge of the language if not from a unity perspective.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h1>English/German</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Uh, yeh, if you're reading this, let's be friends! But my German is only rudimentary.</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Teamwork -</h3>
									&nbsp;
									<h1>Communication</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									If people don't understand the task, twice the work has to be done (or redone), 
									and so I understand how critical effective communication is. 
									This means that I try to make all my communication direct, concise and precise, 
									so there are no missunderstandings. 
									<br>
									Understanding people is also critical in communication, 
									some people may be visual learners, or like to take notes, 
									and so I cater my communication to try and accomodate for all types of people.
								</p>
								<header>
									<h1>Time Management</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									Once again poor time management leads to failed projects and burnout, 
									so I always attempt to stick to a regular schedule that I stay committed to. 
									And when managing other members time, I try to make schedules that work for 
									all involved parties and fits their style of work.
