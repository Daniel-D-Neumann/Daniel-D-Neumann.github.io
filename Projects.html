								<h2>Going Under - Python:</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								This is a project I worked on during college over a period of four months. 
								It was my first experience with creating games and with a lot of time and effort, 
								I built a game from the ground up in python using pygame, a GUI library. 
								I focused on creating: Efficient data structures, of which, a recursive quadtree to handle collisions is what I'm most proud of. 
								Procedural content generation in a similar fashion to spelunky, one of my favorite games. 
								And a declarative menu system, that made me feel like I was using my own engine. 
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>What's the game like?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								There are two game modes, classic and endless, both see the player navigating around procedurally generated levels,
								created using a seed that can be set by the player or randomly generated, 
								collecting treasure, killing enemies, avoiding traps, climbing ladders and ropes, and blowing stuff up! 
								In classic mode after completing 5 levels the player will face a final boss to end the game, 
								but endless features unlimited levels where the player is only stopped by their own skill, 
								encouraging them to reach new high-scores every time they play. 
								After each run the player may unlock several buffs that they can pick from the next time they start a run,
								and have the ability to have multiple saved profiles each with different progress and high-scores. 
								With all these cool features the game can get pretty overwhelming so I also included a save/load feature,
								so a player can put down the game and come back later right where they left off.
							</p>

								<h3>The future of this project:</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, despite this being my first and most memorable coding project, this has fallen to the wayside. 
								With my transition to uni meaning I've switched my main language to c++, 
								I've instead decided to recreate this project in c++,
								and any future developments will likely be applied to that version instead of this one.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>TLDR:</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								A finished games project in python, with self-built data structures, PCG and declaritive built menus.
