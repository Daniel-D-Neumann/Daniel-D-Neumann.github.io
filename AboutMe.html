								<h2>Current Situation:</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Hello there! I'm Daniel Neumann, a university student at Staffordshire University studying BSc(Hons) Games Programming.<br>
								I want to be able to bring the same joy and positive influence games have had on my life to others, 
								and I'm in the process of learning how to do that, so I'm glad you can be a part of this journey.<br>
								I'm constantly looking for new projects to sink my teeth into, or new people to play games with, 
								so let me know if you've got either for me.

								<h2>The Future:</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								My main long term goal is to become a lead games programmer at a major games company, 
								but the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, 
								so my currents goals and aspirations are ever shifting. <br>
								They are currently, making sure I am living 
								a healthy lifestyle, surrounding myself with like-minded people who share my passions for games, 
								and giving my best effort to my university assignments and personal projects to feed my unsatiable hunger to learn new things.<br>
								I'm looking forward to the AI for Games module I will be taking next year in uni!

								<h2>Hobbies and Interests:</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I enjoy attending game or computer science related conferences and talks, 
								as I love to learn about new ideas which provide me with the knowledge to improve my own projects. 
								I have a personal project that I like to adapt whenever I get a new idea, 
								to constantly be improving it and keeping a record so I can see how Iâ€™ve grown and what errors to avoid in future. <br>
								I enjoy board and video games that give me a wide set of complex options so that I can optimise my playstyle and 
								challenge myself by enforcing difficult rules on how I play the game. 
								This is why my favourite game is Divinity Original Sin II (hook me up with an internship Larian) 
								as it allows for such a wide diversity of play and after several hundred hours of play, 
								I am still discovering new ways to optimise it each time I play.<br>
								I also enjoy reading fantasy, basketball, and baking as a pass time.
